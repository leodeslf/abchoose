Save on Google Fonts requests and get only what you need.

## About

An app to get a specific `@font-face` that includes just the characters you choose.

It makes use of the Google Fonts request `text` parameter considerably reducing the amount of requests and the size of them.

The only thing you'll need to bring in is the font(s) URL given by Google Fonts from the `<link>`/`@import`, just copy it all, don't worry.

You'll get feedback about:

- **Character coverage**, preview included & missing characters if any;
- **Saved requests** on Woff2 files;
- **Saved bytes** on CSS & Woff2 files.
